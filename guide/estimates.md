# Estimates

The Estimates page displays all the created estimates. You can create new estimates by selecting an existing customer or adding a new one. 

An estimate can be created using one of the three pre-designed templates. You can add additional taxes to the estimate and also add it as a compound tax. 

Once an estimate is created you can edit, view or mark it as sent. You can also convert a created estimate to an invoice.

## Estimate Lifecycle 

Below are the different statuses of an estimate:

- **Draft:** Estimate has been created but hasn't been sent to the customer.
- **Sent:** Estimate has been sent to the customer
- **Viewed:** Estimate has been viewed by the customer
- **Expired:** Estimate has passed the `expiry_date` set by you
- **Accepted:** Estimate has been accepted by the customer. ( Note: When you convert an estimate into invoice, it automatically gets marked as `Accepted`)
- **Rejected:** Estimate was rejected by the customer.
